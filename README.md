# TriLLM 🤖

**Triple LLM Intelligence** - Query ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude simultaneously to get the best AI answer.

## What is TriLLM?

TriLLM is an AI-powered meta-search engine that:
- 🔍 Takes your question and queries multiple LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude)
- 📊 Compares and ranks responses using intelligent scoring
- ✨ Presents you with the best answer, backed by multiple AI perspectives
- 🎯 Helps you make better decisions with AI consensus

## Why TriLLM?

Different LLMs excel at different tasks:
- **ChatGPT**: Great for conversational and creative tasks
- **Gemini**: Excellent at reasoning and analysis
- **Claude**: Strong at structured thinking and code

Why choose one when you can leverage all three?
